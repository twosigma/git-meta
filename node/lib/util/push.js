 * For a given commit and remote, determine a reasonably close oid that has

 *
 * This works by building a revwalk and removing all ancestors of remote refs
 * for the given remote. It then reverses the result, and returns the first
 * parent of the oldest, unpushed commit. This is not an absolute last pushed
 * oid, but is a very good proxy to determine what to push.
 *
 * Returns a commit that exists in a remote ref, or null if no such commit
 * exists. If the given commit exists in a remote ref, will return itself.

 *
 * Note that this strategy is naive: it does not handle the following
 * situations:
 *
 * - closed submodules with commits that need to be pushed
 * - submodules that do not exist in the `source` commit, but did previously
 *   and need synthetic-meta-refs
 * - submodules with divergent histories, i.e., the commit we create the
 *   synthetic-meta-ref for doesn't contain one or more commits that need to be
 *   pushed in its history
 *
 * Addressing these situations would have a performance impact, requiring
 * calculation and traversal of all meta-repo commits being pushed.  We should
 * probably add a way to do an "exhaustive" push.
