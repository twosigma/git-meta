# What is git-meta?

Git-meta allows developers to work with extremely large codebases --
performance only degrades very slowly when physical size, number of
files, number of contributors increases, or the depth of history grows.
You can use granular ACLs with git-meta to help refine the scope of work.
Users only need to clone the subsets of the code that they need, yet they
can still make atomic commits across the entire codebase.  Development and
collaboration are done mostly using normal Git commands; we provide a Git
plug-in for ease-of-use.

## A little more detail

Git-meta both describes an architecture and provides a set of tools to
facilitate the implementation of a *mono-repo* and attendant workflows.  Aside
from the ability to install the tools provided in this repository, git-meta
requires only Git.  Git-meta is not tied to any specific Git hosting solution,
and does not provide operations that are hosting-solution-specific, such as the
ability to create new (server-side) repositories.

A detailed description of the architecture of Git-meta is provided in
[doc/architecture.md](doc/architecture.md).

# Getting Started

## Installation

To install the git-meta plugin:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/twosigma/git-meta.git
$ cd git-meta/node
$ npm install -g
```

## Quick Start / Basic Usage

### Clone

Clone your organization's meta-repository as you normally would with Git:

```bash
$ git clone http://example.com/my-meta-repo.git meta
$ cd meta
````

At this point, your working directory is likely full of empty directories where
sub-repos are mounted.  Open the one(s) you're interested in working on and
create out a feature branch to work on:

```bash
$ git meta open my-repo
$ git meta checkout -b my-feature
```

Now, change a file:

```bash
$ cd my-repo
$ echo "new work" >> some-file
```

Make a commit:

```bash
$ git meta commit -a -m "I made a change."
```

And push your change back upstream:

```bash
$ git meta push origin my-feature
```
